Project Title: Power BI Personal Project Danesh.pbix :
 
   In this Project I have Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard using a random dataset. The project involved comprehensive data cleaning and transformation using Power Query, followed by building an optimized data model with relationships. Created calculated columns and measures using DAX to derive insights. Designed a dynamic dashboard with multiple visuals, including bar charts, line graphs, and KPIs, and enhanced user experience with bookmarks and slicers for better interactivity and navigation.


Project Title: COVID-19 DATA EXPLORATION AND ANALYSIS (2020-2021)

Description:
This project involved an in-depth exploration of a global COVID-19 dataset, covering total cases, vaccinations, and population data during the 2020-2021 period. The dataset was sourced from the web and analyzed to uncover key insights at both global and continental levels.

Key analyses performed:
Case vs. Population Analysis: Examined the relationship between total COVID-19 cases and population by country.
Mortality Analysis: Compared total deaths to total cases across countries to identify mortality trends.
Infection Rate Analysis: Determined countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.
Death Rate Analysis: Identified countries with the highest death rates relative to their population.
Regional Insights: Conducted similar analyses at the continental and global levels for broader insights.

Technical Skills Applied:
SQL Techniques: Joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Temporary Tables, and Views.
Advanced Functions: Window functions and aggregations for dynamic and cumulative calculations.
Data Transformation: Converting data types to ensure consistency and accuracy in the analysis.
This project highlights my ability to manipulate and analyze complex datasets, delivering actionable insights using SQL and structured data exploration techniques.
