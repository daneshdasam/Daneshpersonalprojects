Project Title: Sales and Returns Analysis Dashboard using Power BI

Description:
In this project, I analyzed sales and returns data for a company selling multiple products across various brands and countries. The data was sourced from multiple files and imported into Power Query, where I performed data cleaning, transformation, and normalization to ensure consistency.

Key Steps and Techniques Used:
Data Preparation:
Imported data from various sources into Power Query.
Cleaned, transformed, and normalized the data for analysis.

Data Modeling:
Created relationships between normalized tables to enable seamless analysis.
Added calculated columns and measures using DAX to derive key metrics like overall sales, revenue, profit, and return percentage.

Dashboard Design and Visualization:
Designed an executive-friendly dashboard with a focus on delivering actionable insights to key decision-makers like a CFO.

Key Metrics: Added four summary cards at the top to display Overall Sales, Revenue, Profit, and Return Percentage.
Performance Trends: Created a line chart to analyze the performance of key metrics over time using a Field Parameter for switching metrics dynamically.
Product Insights: Matrix table showcasing the Top 10 Products by Revenue. Cards indicating the Most Ordered Product and the Most Returned Product.
KPI Indicators: Added KPIs to compare Monthly Revenue, Transactions, and Profit Margin against the previous month.
Slicers and Interactivity: Designed a Selection Panel using bookmarks to toggle visibility, enabling users to filter data by Country and Year for deeper analysis.

Key Insights Identified:
Top Revenue Generators: Identified the top 10 products contributing the most to revenue, helping to prioritize best-performing products.
High Return Rate Products: Pinpointed the most returned products, allowing the business to investigate quality or customer satisfaction issues.
Performance Trends Over Time: Highlighted seasonal trends and fluctuations in sales, profit, and returns, helping with inventory and strategy planning.
Monthly Comparisons: Showed areas of improvement by comparing monthly revenue, transactions, and profit margins against the previous month.
Geographic Insights: Analyzed country-level performance to determine regions contributing the most to sales and those with higher return rates.

This dashboard provides a clear, interactive, and data-driven approach to understanding sales performance, product trends, and returns, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.

Project Title: COVID-19 DATA EXPLORATION AND ANALYSIS (2020-2021)

Description:
This project involved an in-depth exploration of a global COVID-19 dataset, covering total cases, vaccinations, and population data during the 2020-2021 period. The dataset was sourced from the web and analyzed to uncover key insights at both global and continental levels.

Key analyses performed:
Case vs. Population Analysis: Examined the relationship between total COVID-19 cases and population by country.
Mortality Analysis: Compared total deaths to total cases across countries to identify mortality trends.
Infection Rate Analysis: Determined countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.
Death Rate Analysis: Identified countries with the highest death rates relative to their population.
Regional Insights: Conducted similar analyses at the continental and global levels for broader insights.

Technical Skills Applied: SQL Techniques: Joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Temporary Tables, and Views.
Advanced Functions: Window functions and aggregations for dynamic and cumulative calculations.
Data Transformation: Converting data types to ensure consistency and accuracy in the analysis.

This project highlights my ability to manipulate and analyze complex datasets, delivering actionable insights using SQL and structured data exploration techniques.
